	<h1> Online Multiplayer Card Game - <a target="_blank" 
		href="https://desolate-woodland-61499.herokuapp.com/demo/">
			Heroku
		</a></h1>
	<p class='projectDescription'>
		A card game heavily based on "Cards Against Humanity". I used a Django-based framework called 
		oTree that I use in my work for the Economics department at UCSC. It's meant for economics experiments,
		but I didn't want to limit my use of it to that. 
		<br><br>
		Anyone can create a game session, and their friends can join through links that the game generates.
		The actual game draws from a text file of Cards Against Humanity cards, but the
		 GIF below shows dummy text for the cards since many of the cards aren't safe for work.




		<br><br>Note: for some reason, only the single use links for each session work if
		 multiple devices are used for a game.

	<h1> Reddit CLI - <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/jeffreyyang3/redditScript">
		GitHub
	</a></h1>
	<p class = 'projectDescription'>
		 A Python script I wrote to browse Reddit through the command line. Perfect for wasting time
		 while making it look like you're hard at work. It uses urllib3, and Python's standard JSON
		 and text wrapping libraries. With this script, one can continually browse subreddits
		 and posts. <br><br>In the process of writing the program, I had problems accounting for differing reply
		 depth on different comments. I fixed the problems with a recursive approach.
		It wasn't anything very advanced, but it felt nice to finally apply that concept in a
		non academic setting. <br><br>
		I also wrote a version that used only built-in libraries. It's in the notUrllib3 folder. I wrote it so I could run the script on our school's 
		UNIX timeshare. I can't think of any realistic situations where I would need to do that, but I'll feel really good 
		about myself if a situation like that does come up.
